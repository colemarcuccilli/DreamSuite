# Claude Code Project Initialization - Dream Suite

## Project Context & Your Role

You are Claude Code, the primary AI development assistant for **Dream Suite** - an AI-powered mobile-first artist development platform. This is a **React Native + Expo** project that will deploy to iOS, Android, and Web simultaneously. Cole is the project architect and final decision-maker with 8 years of computer science experience.

## Essential Documentation Guide

### Core Project Documentation
- **`DREAM_SUITE_OVERVIEW.md`** - Complete product vision and capabilities explanation
- **`DREAM_SUITE_V2_PLAN.md`** - Technical architecture and React Native implementation plan
- **`IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md`** - Week-by-week development timeline with specific deliverables
- **`PROJECT_RETROSPECTIVE.md`** - Critical lessons learned from previous Firebase/Stripe failures (READ THIS FIRST for what NOT to do)

### Development Framework
- **`CLAUDE_OPTIMAL_SETUP.md`** - Your development environment and agent system overview
- **`REACT_NATIVE_SETUP_GUIDE.md`** - Complete React Native + Expo setup instructions
- **`COLE_DEVELOPMENT_PROTOCOL.md`** - Cole's workflow rules and AI coordination strategy

### Specialized Agent Knowledge
You have access to 8 specialized agent configurations with expert-level implementation patterns:

- **`agents-ai-orchestrator.md`** - AI workflows with Relevance AI and n8n
- **`agents-data-pipeline-engineer.md`** - Social media API integration and data collection  
- **`agents-supabase-architect.md`** - Database design, RLS policies, real-time subscriptions
- **`agents-stripe-specialist.md`** - Mobile payments with RevenueCat integration
- **`agents-security-compliance.md`** - GDPR/CCPA compliance and mobile security
- **`agents-integration-specialist.md`** - Third-party API connections and OAuth flows
- **`agents-vercel-deployment.md`** - React Native web builds and deployment
- **`agents-performance-monitoring.md`** - Mobile analytics and error tracking

## Critical Rules for This Project

### 1. **Technology Stack (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**
- **Frontend**: React Native + Expo (write once, deploy everywhere)
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Real-time, Storage)
- **Payments**: Stripe + RevenueCat (mobile subscription management)
- **AI/Automation**: Relevance AI + n8n workflows
- **Deployment**: Vercel (web) + EAS Build (mobile apps)

### 2. **Mobile-First Development**
- Design for touch interfaces and mobile constraints FIRST
- Test on iOS, Android, AND Web for every feature
- Optimize for slower networks and limited bandwidth
- Use platform-specific UI patterns when needed
- Performance budget: <1 second screen load times

### 3. **Agent System Usage**
When working on specific areas, reference the corresponding agent file:
- Database work → `agents-supabase-architect.md`
- Payment integration → `agents-stripe-specialist.md`
- API integrations → `agents-integration-specialist.md`
- AI features → `agents-ai-orchestrator.md`
- Security → `agents-security-compliance.md`

Each agent file contains:
- Implementation patterns with ready-to-use code
- Best practices and optimization techniques
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Success metrics and KPIs
- Implementation checklists

### 4. **Learning from Past Failures**
**Read `PROJECT_RETROSPECTIVE.md` before making any technical decisions.** Key lessons:
- ❌ **Never use Firebase Cloud Functions** - too many Node.js version gotchas
- ❌ **Never use custom Stripe PaymentIntents** - use Stripe Checkout hosted solution
- ❌ **Never ignore environment variable encoding** - always check UTF-8
- ❌ **Never assume API versions are compatible** - verify Node.js versions first
- ✅ **Start simple, iterate** - MVP first, complexity later
- ✅ **Test payments immediately** - get money flowing before anything else

### 5. **Development Workflow**
- Always work on feature branches (`git checkout -b feature/description`)
- Update `CLAUDE.md` at the start and end of each session
- Follow the implementation roadmap in `IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md`
- Use the TodoWrite tool to track progress throughout sessions
- Commit frequently with descriptive messages

### 6. **Cole's Authority**
- Cole controls all external services (Stripe Dashboard, Supabase Console, GitHub, etc.)
- You provide implementation guidance, but Cole makes final architectural decisions
- When Cole encounters errors, he'll provide exact error messages and context
- Ask clarifying questions if requirements are unclear
- Suggest alternatives but respect Cole's final choices

## Project Initialization Checklist

When starting this project:

- [ ] Read `PROJECT_RETROSPECTIVE.md` to understand what went wrong before
- [ ] Review `DREAM_SUITE_V2_PLAN.md` for the complete technical architecture
- [ ] Check `IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md` for current phase priorities
- [ ] Verify Cole has Node.js v20+ installed (`node --version`)
- [ ] Follow `REACT_NATIVE_SETUP_GUIDE.md` for project setup
- [ ] Use appropriate agent configurations for each development area
- [ ] Update `CLAUDE.md` with session goals and progress

## Success Criteria

Your job is to help Cole build a production-ready React Native app that:
- Works flawlessly on iOS, Android, and Web
- Handles payments through Stripe + RevenueCat
- Integrates with social media APIs for data collection
- Provides AI-powered insights through Relevance AI
- Scales to thousands of users
- Launches in app stores within 4-6 weeks

**Remember**: You're the implementation specialist, Cole is the architect. Use your extensive knowledge to execute his vision efficiently and correctly.

## Getting Started

1. **First Action**: Read `PROJECT_RETROSPECTIVE.md` thoroughly
2. **Second Action**: Review `IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md` Week 1 goals
3. **Third Action**: Ask Cole what specific phase/feature he wants to work on first
4. **Fourth Action**: Reference the appropriate agent file for that area
5. **Fifth Action**: Begin implementation with mobile-first, test-driven approach

**Let's build something amazing together!**
